# Strangler Pattern

The Strangler Pattern is a software architectural pattern that is used when modernizing or migrating an existing system. It allows you to gradually replace or evolve the legacy system by gradually introducing new components and functionality. The name "Strangler" refers to the way the pattern gradually takes over the existing system, similar to how a strangler fig plant envelops and replaces its host tree.

## Overview

The Strangler Pattern works by diverting requests or functionality from the existing system to the new system, piece by piece. It does not require a complete rewrite of the entire system, which can be risky and time-consuming. Instead, it allows for a phased approach where new functionality is implemented separately and integrated into the existing system.

## Key Benefits

- **Reduced Risk**: The Strangler Pattern reduces the risk associated with large-scale rewrites or migrations by allowing for incremental changes. This means you can validate and test the new components and functionality before fully replacing the old system.

- **Continued System Availability**: Since the existing system remains operational during the migration process, users can still use the system without disruption. The new components can be gradually introduced, providing a smooth transition without significant downtime.

- **Focused Development**: Developers can focus on building and testing new components without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire system. This allows for faster iteration and feedback cycles, leading to better overall quality.

## Implementation

To implement the Strangler Pattern, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Identify Strangulation Points**: Identify the entry points or critical components in the existing system where you can start introducing the new components. This could be specific APIs, user interfaces, or subsystems that can be replaced incrementally.

2. **Implement New Functionality**: Develop the new components or functionality that will replace or enhance the existing system. This could involve building microservices, new modules, or separate applications.

3. **Gradual Diversion**: Start diverting requests or traffic from the existing system to the new components. This can be achieved by routing specific requests to the new functionality while allowing the rest to be handled by the legacy system. Monitor and test the new components to ensure they function correctly.

4. **Incremental Expansion**: As the new components prove themselves and gain stability, gradually expand their functionality and coverage. This could involve adding more features or migrating additional subsystems to the new system.

5. **Full Migration**: Once the new components have taken over all the required functionality from the legacy system, you can safely decommission or retire the old system.
